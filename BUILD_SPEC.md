# Steven Piano — engineering spec

Android app: plays a library of Standard MIDI Files on the "Steven Piano" self-playing
piano over **Bluetooth LE MIDI**. Sideloaded as an APK. Read `DESIGN.md` first — it is
the design of record and wins on anything visual. The approved implementation plan
(package layout, milestones, pitfalls) supersedes this file where they differ.

Made by Steven Jin. Package `dev.stevenjin.stevenpiano`. App name **Steven Piano**.
Folder: `Player Piano/android/` (its own git repo; never pushed without Steven's say-so).

## Stack

- Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Material 3. Single module `app/`. Scaffolded with
  `android create empty-activity` (AGP 9, Gradle wrapper checked in, built-in Kotlin —
  do **not** apply `org.jetbrains.kotlin.android`).
- `minSdk 26`, `targetSdk 34`, `compileSdk 36`. Gradle Kotlin DSL + version catalog.
- Room (KSP), DataStore Preferences, coroutines/Flow, Navigation-Compose,
  androidx.media (`MediaSessionCompat`, MediaStyle notification).
- No network. No analytics. No accounts. No Accompanist (archived) — permissions via
  `rememberLauncherForActivityResult`.
- Toolchain on this Mac: `JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17`,
  `ANDROID_HOME=/opt/homebrew/share/android-commandlinetools`, `local.properties`
  `sdk.dir` pointing there. The `android` CLI needs `--sdk=$ANDROID_HOME`.

## The piano's MIDI contract (firmware facts — the app must match them)

- BLE-MIDI service `03B80E5A-EDE8-4B33-A751-6CE34EC4C700`, characteristic
  `7772E5DB-3868-4112-A1A9-F2669D106BF3`, name "Steven Piano" **in the scan response**
  (scan by service UUID), no bonding, no encryption, one central at a time.
- **Timestamps are discarded** by the piano: events play on arrival. The phone owns
  timing and pacing. Packet framing: header byte, then a timestamp byte before **every**
  status byte; running status only within a packet.
- Throughput ≈ 1000 messages/s; a 64-byte receive queue (~21 messages) blocks the
  piano's Bluetooth task when full → **token bucket: burst 20, refill 1 message/ms**.
- Honoured: Note On/Off, Note On vel 0, CC64 (≥64 down), CC120/121/123 (all = every key
  off + pedal up). Everything else ignored. Channel numbers discarded (OMNI).
- Notes outside MIDI **24–107 are dropped** → the app folds by octave (default) or drops.
- No per-key reference counting in the piano → the app reference-counts sent keys.
- Retrigger: Note Off must precede a re-strike; 30 ms min gap; 60–95 ms min strike →
  **same-key onsets ≥ 100 ms apart** (thin faster repeats); **off before on** at equal
  times.
- Hold ceiling 2 s (firmware cuts long notes). Velocity: **send raw** file velocities.
- Stop sequence: **CC64=0 then CC123** (in that order, one packet, one channel).
  CC120/121/123 from files are never forwarded (CC121 is common at bar 1).

## MIDI file parsing — `midi/SmfParser.kt`

- Format 0 and 1 (2 and SMPTE division rejected with plain-English `SmfException`s).
- `MThd` with extra header bytes skipped; unknown chunks skipped; a track length past
  EOF parsed as far as it goes with a warning (`piano-midi.de/borodin/bor_ps5.mid`).
- Running status (meta cancels it), variable-length quantities, SysEx skipped, meta:
  0x51 tempo, 0x03 track name (Track 0's = `sequenceName`), 0x01/0x02 text, 0x02
  copyright. Text decoded as UTF-8 if valid, else ISO-8859-1.
- Tracks merged stably by (tick, rank: tempo 0, CC 1, note-off/vel-0 2, note-on 3).
- Tempo map → exact `Long` microseconds per segment (default 120 BPM).
- Output `MidiPiece(sequenceName, texts, copyright, format, ppq, durationMicros,
  events: List<TimedEvent>, notes: NoteList, noteCount, warnings)`; `TimedEvent(atMicros,
  status, data1, data2)`; `NoteList` = parallel arrays sorted by start with
  `maxDurationMicros` (for the canvas).

## Note routing — `midi/KeyMap.kt`, `midi/NoteRouter.kt`

- `KeyMap.map(note, transpose, fold)`: transpose, then fold by octaves into 24–107
  (`while (n < 24) n += 12; while (n > 107) n -= 12`) or `-1` when folding is off.
- `NoteRouter` state: `sentKeyForSource[16×128]`, `refCount[128]`, `lastOnsetMicros[128]`.
  - Note On: implicit off if that source is already sounding; drum channel 10 skipped
    when the setting is on; map; thin if the key had an onset < 100 ms ago and is not
    held; send `0x90 key clamp(1..127, vel × pct/100)` only when the count goes 0→1.
  - Note Off: release the **sent** key at 1→0 (a transpose change mid-note still
    releases the right key).
  - CC: only CC64 passes. Program change, pitch bend, aftertouch: dropped.
  - `silence()`: `B0 40 00`, `B0 7B 00`, state cleared.

## Playback — `player/`

- `PlaybackEngine` is pure (clock injected): `songMicros = anchorSong + (now − anchorNanos)
  × tempoPct / 100`; play and tempo changes re-anchor at the current position (no jump);
  `advance(nowNanos)` emits everything due through the router into one batch and returns
  the next wake time; pause / seek / stop **silence first**; on seek or resume, re-send
  the CC64 value in effect at the target.
- `Scheduler`: one dedicated thread ("steven-piano-scheduler", urgent-audio priority),
  commands via a blocking queue with a timed poll. No coroutine `delay` in the hot path.
- `Player` (process singleton in `AppGraph`): `StateFlow<PlayerState>` (status,
  piece, tempo, transpose, velocity, fold, queue position), allocation-free
  `positionMicrosNow()` for the canvas, active keys as two `AtomicLong` bitsets,
  `play(pieceId, queue)`, `togglePlayPause`, `pause`, `stop`, `seek`, `next`,
  `previous` (restart when > 3 s in), setters, `stopAndFlush(timeoutMs)`.
- End of piece: silence, then auto-advance to the next queued piece after 1.5 s.
- Tempo 25–200 %, transpose −12…+12, velocity 50–150 %.

## Bluetooth — `ble/`

- Own `BluetoothGatt` client (`GattPianoLink`), behind the `PianoLink` interface
  (`state: StateFlow<LinkState>`, `connect(address?)`, `disconnect()`, `send(batch)`,
  `flush(timeoutMs)`). `LinkState`: Disconnected / Scanning / Connecting / Connected(name,
  mtu) / Reconnecting(attempt) / Error(message).
- Sequence: filtered scan (service UUID, low latency, 12 s timeout; stop before
  connecting) → `connectGatt(ctx, false, cb, TRANSPORT_LE)` → `requestMtu(255)` and use
  `onMtuChanged`'s value → `discoverServices` (retry once) → characteristic
  `WRITE_TYPE_NO_RESPONSE`, `requestConnectionPriority(HIGH)` → Connected; persist the
  address and name.
- One GATT operation in flight, always; next packet only after `onCharacteristicWrite`
  (API 33+ `writeCharacteristic(ch, bytes, type)` returns 201 BUSY otherwise). Copy byte
  arrays. Callbacks arrive on a Binder thread: hand off, never block.
- `BleMidiFramer`: header + timestamp before every status; ≤ 20 messages per packet;
  payload ≤ MTU − 3. `PacedWriter`: token bucket 20 / 1 per ms.
- Drop: `gatt.close()`, `Reconnecting(n)`, `connectGatt(autoConnect = true)` on the
  cached device plus a filtered scan with backoff 1/2/4…15 s after 20 s (when
  auto-connect is on). User disconnect pauses the player first. Adapter off/on via a
  receiver. `LoggingPianoLink` (debug builds only) for the emulator.
- Permissions: API 31+ `BLUETOOTH_SCAN` (`neverForLocation`) + `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT`;
  API 26–30 `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` (`maxSdkVersion 30`)
  and Location Services on. Asked from the Piano tab with a one-line reason.

## Background playback — `service/`

- `PlaybackService`: foreground service `mediaPlayback`, started from the play button,
  `startForeground` within 5 s, MediaStyle notification (play/pause, title; monochrome
  small icon), `MediaSessionCompat` mirroring `PlayerState`, partial wake lock only while
  playing, `stopForeground(DETACH)` on pause, `stopSelf` on stop. `onTaskRemoved` and
  `onDestroy` → `player.stopAndFlush(300)`. `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` requested in context on
  first play (API 33+).
- Playback **continues with the screen off**. The piano is silenced on pause, stop,
  seek, link drop, task removal and service destroy — not on every app background.
- `ImportService`: foreground service `dataSync` running the importer with a progress
  notification; SAF grants are per process, so imports run here, in-app.

## Library — `data/`

- Room entities: `PieceEntity(id, title, composer, composerKey, collection?, sha256
  unique, fileName, sourceName, sizeBytes, durationMs, noteCount, addedAt, favorite,
  playCount, lastPlayedAt?, searchText)`, `CollectionEntity(id, name, createdAt,
  imported)`, `CollectionPieceEntity(collectionId, pieceId)` with cascade.
- Files at `filesDir/pieces/<sha256>.mid`.
- Categories: **All** (title, ASCII-folded sort) · **Collections** (user folders and
  imported INDEX.csv collections) · **Composers** (group by `composerKey`, show
  `MIN(composer)`) · **Favorites** · **Recent** (`COALESCE(lastPlayedAt, addedAt) DESC
  LIMIT 100`). Search: case-insensitive contains on `searchText` (title + composer).
- Import sources: multi-select file picker; **folder** (`ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE`,
  recursive via `DocumentsContract` child queries — not `DocumentFile`); **zip**
  (`java.util.zip.ZipFile`, UTF-8, copied to cache first); "Open with" (`ACTION_VIEW`,
  `ACTION_SEND`, `ACTION_SEND_MULTIPLE`; MIME `audio/midi`, `audio/mid`, `audio/x-midi`,
  `application/x-midi`, plus `application/octet-stream` and `*/*` with `.mid`/`.midi`
  path patterns).
- Pipeline per file: bytes (8 MB cap) → SHA-256 → duplicate check (skip; fill a blank
  composer if the new import knows one) → parse (failure counted, logged) → metadata:
  `INDEX.csv` row if present (columns `collection,composer,title,size_kb,path`, RFC-4180
  quoting, path relative to the root) → else `^(.+?) - (.+)$` filename split → else
  title = file name; a stub title (`^[a-z0-9_\-\.]+$`) is replaced by Track 0's name when
  it contains a space and is not a generic name (control track, upper, lower, piano,
  track, untitled…) → `ComposerNames`: display name, surname, ASCII-folded lowercase
  `composerKey` ("" when unknown), override table for the 26 lowercase piano-midi.de
  folder names (`rachmaninow → Sergei Rachmaninoff`, `burgmueller → Friedrich Burgmüller`,
  `balakirew → Mily Balakirev`, `xmas → Traditional`, …); `ALL SONGS` names are
  double-encoded UTF-8 and are repaired
  (`String(name.toByteArray(ISO_8859_1), UTF_8)` when the name contains `Ã`/`â`) → write
  file → insert (transactions of 25) → CSV `collection` → get-or-create an imported
  `CollectionEntity` and link.
- `ImportProgress(done, total, imported, duplicates, failed, current, finished)` as a
  `StateFlow` in `AppGraph`.

## Settings — `settings/`

DataStore keys: `autoConnect: Boolean (true)`, `lastDeviceAddress: String?`,
`lastDeviceName: String?`, `noteDisplay: PAPER_ROLL | FALLING (PAPER_ROLL)`,
`defaultTempoPct: Int (100)`, `transpose: Int (0)`, `velocityPct: Int (100)`,
`foldOutOfRange: Boolean (true)`, `skipDrumChannel: Boolean (true)`.

## UI contract

- Use the provided `ui/theme` files **unchanged** (`PianoTheme`, `PianoTypography`,
  `PianoShapes`, `Tabular`, `Motion`, `rememberReducedMotion`, `LocalLive`,
  `LocalHairline`, `LocalDisabledGlyph`, `LocalTertiary`). Colour roles: contentPrimary
  = `colorScheme.onSurface`, contentSecondary = `colorScheme.onSurfaceVariant`,
  contentTertiary = `LocalTertiary.current`, hairline = `LocalHairline.current`,
  surfaceElevated = `colorScheme.surfaceVariant`. No colour literal outside `ui/theme`.
  Red (`LocalLive.current`) is read by `LiveDot` only.
- Screens and behaviour exactly as `DESIGN.md`. Bottom `NavigationBar`, three tabs:
  Library, Now playing, Piano. Single activity, Navigation-Compose, fade-through 240 ms
  between tabs (a cut under reduced motion).
- `NoteCanvas` (one `Canvas`, two styles from the `noteDisplay` setting): 84 lanes for
  MIDI 24–107 via a shared `KeyLayout`; notes travel **downward** in both styles.
  *Paper roll*: perforation-styled rounded bars, tracker bar (2 dp `onSurface`) one third
  up from the bottom with a 1 dp hairline 6 dp above it, history visible below.
  *Falling notes*: block-styled bars, hit line at the top of the keyboard strip, no
  history. Upcoming notes `onSurfaceVariant`; a note flips to `onSurface` over 120 ms as
  it crosses the line (cut under reduced motion) and stays so for its duration. Notes in
  start-sorted parallel arrays, binary search for the visible window, `withFrameNanos`
  writes one `Long` state read only inside `drawBehind`, `drawRoundRect` only, no
  per-note allocation, 60 fps with a 5,000-note piece. 320 ms ease-out from still to
  moving on play. Reduced motion: the canvas still moves (it is content), decorations cut.
- `KeyboardStrip`: 84 keys on a `Canvas`, active keys inverted, reads the two
  `AtomicLong` bitsets per frame.
- Timers use `Tabular`; eyebrow labels are `uppercase()` at the call site.
- Every icon-only control has a `contentDescription`. Layouts survive font scale 2.0.
- About row on the Piano tab shows `Provenance.text` ("Steven Piano · Made by Steven Jin
  · v1.0 · eab16a502f679465") and a one-line acknowledgement of the library sources.

## Authorship

- Every `.kt`, `.kts`, `.toml`, `.xml`, `.md`, `.py` starts with the adapted banner
  (copyright Steven Jin, attribution must be preserved, Ed25519 fingerprint
  `eab16a502f679465`, see `firmware/src/main.cpp:1-8`).
- `Provenance.kt`: `@Keep object` with the compiled-in string (R8 `-keep`), shown by the
  About row and duplicated as a manifest `<meta-data>`.
- `LICENSE` (MIT + attribution clause), `AUTHORS`, `PROVENANCE.md` adapted from
  `firmware/`; `provenance/sign.py` + `verify.py` variants over this tree (exclude
  `.git .gradle .kotlin .idea build .claude`; include `.kt .kts .toml .xml .md .py .pro
  .pem`, `LICENSE`, `AUTHORS`, `.gitignore`, `gradlew`, `gradle.properties`,
  `gradle-wrapper.properties`); public key copied from `firmware/provenance/`; the
  private key stays at `~/piano-authorship-PRIVATE-DO-NOT-SHARE.pem`, never in the repo
  (`.gitignore`: `*.pem`, `*PRIVATE*`, `!provenance/author_ed25519_public.pem`).

## Build & sideload

- `./gradlew assembleDebug assembleRelease testDebugUnitTest` must succeed from a clean
  checkout with JDK 17 and the Android SDK present (AGP fetches platform 36).
- `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk` for sideloading; release is signed with
  the debug keystore and minified (`-keep` for `Provenance`).
- `README.md`: what it is, build, sideload (Install unknown apps / `adb install`),
  importing the `midi/` folder or `ALL-SONGS.zip`, connecting (forget any stale
  "Steven Piano" bond first), battery-optimisation exemption, the device checklist.

## Acceptance

1. Import three `.mid` files via the picker; sensible titles; search finds them; a
   collection can be created and populated. Import the `midi/` folder: 1,727 pieces
   grouped by collection and composer.
2. Connect to "Steven Piano" from the Piano tab; the dot goes live; status Connected.
3. Play: the canvas moves, notes brighten crossing the line, the keyboard strip inverts,
   timers count with tabular figures, the piano plays in time. Tempo 50 % halves the
   rate live. Switching Note display while playing is seamless. Pause silences within
   ~50 ms (CC64=0 then CC123). Seek silences then resumes.
4. Lock the phone: playback continues from the notification. Swipe the app away: the
   piano is silent. Power-cycle the piano: the app reconnects within ~15 s.
5. Rotate, font scale 2.0, TalkBack: nothing overlaps, everything is labelled.
6. Unit tests green; no colour literal outside `ui/theme`; `LocalLive` only in
   `LiveDot.kt`; provenance verifies; the provenance string is in the release DEX.
