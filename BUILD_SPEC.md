# Steven Piano — engineering spec

Android app: plays a library of Standard MIDI Files on the "Steven Piano" self-playing
piano over **Bluetooth LE MIDI**. Sideloaded as an APK. Read `DESIGN.md` first — it is
the design of record and wins on anything visual. The approved implementation plan
(package layout, milestones, pitfalls) supersedes this file where they differ.

Made by Steven Jin. Package `dev.stevenjin.stevenpiano`. App name **Steven Piano**.
Folder: `Player Piano/android/` (its own git repo; never pushed without Steven's say-so).

## Stack

- Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Material 3. Single module `app/`. Scaffolded with
  `android create empty-activity` (AGP 9, Gradle wrapper checked in, built-in Kotlin —
  do **not** apply `org.jetbrains.kotlin.android`).
- `minSdk 26`, `targetSdk 34`, `compileSdk 36`. Gradle Kotlin DSL + version catalog.
- Room (KSP), DataStore Preferences, coroutines/Flow, Navigation-Compose,
  androidx.media (`MediaSessionCompat`, MediaStyle notification).
- No analytics. No accounts. No Accompanist (archived) — permissions via
  `rememberLauncherForActivityResult`. Network (from v1.2, M11): exactly two hosts,
  `en.wikipedia.org` and `upload.wikimedia.org`, for composers' portraits and notes; what is
  sent is page titles and search terms made from the library's own names, nothing about the
  person (see `v1.2 — M11 › Network policy`).
- Toolchain on this Mac: `JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17`,
  `ANDROID_HOME=/opt/homebrew/share/android-commandlinetools`, `local.properties`
  `sdk.dir` pointing there. The `android` CLI needs `--sdk=$ANDROID_HOME`.

## The piano's MIDI contract (firmware facts — the app must match them)

- BLE-MIDI service `03B80E5A-EDE8-4B33-A751-6CE34EC4C700`, characteristic
  `7772E5DB-3868-4112-A1A9-F2669D106BF3`, name "Steven Piano" **in the scan response**
  (scan by service UUID), no bonding, no encryption, one central at a time.
- **Timestamps are discarded** by the piano: events play on arrival. The phone owns
  timing and pacing. Packet framing: header byte, then a timestamp byte before **every**
  status byte; running status only within a packet.
- Throughput ≈ 1000 messages/s; a 64-byte receive queue (~21 messages) blocks the
  piano's Bluetooth task when full → **token bucket: burst 20, refill 1 message/ms**.
- Honoured: Note On/Off, Note On vel 0, CC64 (≥64 down), CC120/121/123 (all = every key
  off + pedal up). Everything else ignored. Channel numbers discarded (OMNI).
- Notes outside MIDI **24–107 are dropped** → the app folds by octave (default) or drops.
- No per-key reference counting in the piano → the app reference-counts sent keys.
- Retrigger: Note Off must precede a re-strike; 30 ms min gap; 60–95 ms min strike →
  **same-key onsets ≥ 100 ms apart** (thin faster repeats); **off before on** at equal
  times.
- Hold ceiling 2 s (firmware cuts long notes). Velocity: **send raw** file velocities.
- Stop sequence: **CC64=0 then CC123** (in that order, one packet, one channel).
  CC120/121/123 from files are never forwarded (CC121 is common at bar 1).

## MIDI file parsing — `midi/SmfParser.kt`

- Format 0 and 1 (2 and SMPTE division rejected with plain-English `SmfException`s).
- `MThd` with extra header bytes skipped; unknown chunks skipped; a track length past
  EOF parsed as far as it goes with a warning (`piano-midi.de/borodin/bor_ps5.mid`).
- Running status (meta cancels it), variable-length quantities, SysEx skipped, meta:
  0x51 tempo, 0x03 track name (Track 0's = `sequenceName`), 0x01/0x02 text, 0x02
  copyright. Text decoded as UTF-8 if valid, else ISO-8859-1.
- Tracks merged stably by (tick, rank: tempo 0, CC 1, note-off/vel-0 2, note-on 3).
- Tempo map → exact `Long` microseconds per segment (default 120 BPM).
- Output `MidiPiece(sequenceName, texts, copyright, format, ppq, durationMicros,
  events: List<TimedEvent>, notes: NoteList, noteCount, warnings)`; `TimedEvent(atMicros,
  status, data1, data2)`; `NoteList` = parallel arrays sorted by start with
  `maxDurationMicros` (for the canvas).

## Note routing — `midi/KeyMap.kt`, `midi/NoteRouter.kt`

- `KeyMap.map(note, transpose, fold)`: transpose, then fold by octaves into 24–107
  (`while (n < 24) n += 12; while (n > 107) n -= 12`) or `-1` when folding is off.
- `NoteRouter` state: `sentKeyForSource[16×128]`, `refCount[128]`, `lastOnsetMicros[128]`.
  - Note On: implicit off if that source is already sounding; drum channel 10 skipped
    when the setting is on; map; thin if the key had an onset < 100 ms ago and is not
    held; send `0x90 key clamp(1..127, vel × pct/100)` only when the count goes 0→1.
  - Note Off: release the **sent** key at 1→0 (a transpose change mid-note still
    releases the right key).
  - CC: only CC64 passes. Program change, pitch bend, aftertouch: dropped.
  - `silence()`: `B0 40 00`, `B0 7B 00`, state cleared.

## Playback — `player/`

- `PlaybackEngine` is pure (clock injected): `songMicros = anchorSong + (now − anchorNanos)
  × tempoPct / 100`; play and tempo changes re-anchor at the current position (no jump);
  `advance(nowNanos)` emits everything due through the router into one batch and returns
  the next wake time; pause / seek / stop **silence first**; on seek or resume, re-send
  the CC64 value in effect at the target.
- `Scheduler`: one dedicated thread ("steven-piano-scheduler", urgent-audio priority),
  commands via a blocking queue with a timed poll. No coroutine `delay` in the hot path.
- `Player` (process singleton in `AppGraph`): `StateFlow<PlayerState>` (status,
  piece, tempo, transpose, velocity, fold, queue position), allocation-free
  `positionMicrosNow()` for the canvas, active keys as two `AtomicLong` bitsets,
  `play(pieceId, queue)`, `togglePlayPause`, `pause`, `stop`, `seek`, `next`,
  `previous` (restart when > 3 s in), setters, `stopAndFlush(timeoutMs)`.
- End of piece: silence, then auto-advance to the next queued piece after 1.5 s.
- Tempo 25–200 %, transpose −12…+12, velocity 50–150 %.

## Bluetooth — `ble/`

- Own `BluetoothGatt` client (`GattPianoLink`), behind the `PianoLink` interface
  (`state: StateFlow<LinkState>`, `connect(address?)`, `disconnect()`, `send(batch)`,
  `flush(timeoutMs)`). `LinkState`: Disconnected / Scanning / Connecting / Connected(name,
  mtu) / Reconnecting(attempt) / Error(message).
- Sequence: filtered scan (service UUID, low latency, 12 s timeout; stop before
  connecting) → `connectGatt(ctx, false, cb, TRANSPORT_LE)` → `requestMtu(255)` and use
  `onMtuChanged`'s value → `discoverServices` (retry once) → characteristic
  `WRITE_TYPE_NO_RESPONSE`, `requestConnectionPriority(HIGH)` → Connected; persist the
  address and name.
- One GATT operation in flight, always; next packet only after `onCharacteristicWrite`
  (API 33+ `writeCharacteristic(ch, bytes, type)` returns 201 BUSY otherwise). Copy byte
  arrays. Callbacks arrive on a Binder thread: hand off, never block.
- `BleMidiFramer`: header + timestamp before every status; ≤ 20 messages per packet;
  payload ≤ MTU − 3. `PacedWriter`: token bucket 20 / 1 per ms.
- Drop: `gatt.close()`, `Reconnecting(n)`, `connectGatt(autoConnect = true)` on the
  cached device plus a filtered scan with backoff 1/2/4…15 s after 20 s (when
  auto-connect is on). User disconnect pauses the player first. Adapter off/on via a
  receiver. `LoggingPianoLink` (debug builds only) for the emulator.
- Permissions: API 31+ `BLUETOOTH_SCAN` (`neverForLocation`) + `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT`;
  API 26–30 `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` (`maxSdkVersion 30`)
  and Location Services on. Asked from the Piano tab with a one-line reason.

## Background playback — `service/`

- `PlaybackService`: foreground service `mediaPlayback`, started from the play button,
  `startForeground` within 5 s, MediaStyle notification (play/pause, title; monochrome
  small icon), `MediaSessionCompat` mirroring `PlayerState`, partial wake lock only while
  playing, `stopForeground(DETACH)` on pause, `stopSelf` on stop. `onTaskRemoved` and
  `onDestroy` → `player.stopAndFlush(300)`. `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` requested in context on
  first play (API 33+).
- Playback **continues with the screen off**. The piano is silenced on pause, stop,
  seek, link drop, task removal and service destroy — not on every app background.
- `ImportService`: foreground service `dataSync` running the importer with a progress
  notification; SAF grants are per process, so imports run here, in-app.

## Library — `data/`

- Room entities: `PieceEntity(id, title, composer, composerKey, collection?, sha256
  unique, fileName, sourceName, sizeBytes, durationMs, noteCount, addedAt, favorite,
  playCount, lastPlayedAt?, searchText)`, `CollectionEntity(id, name, createdAt,
  imported)`, `CollectionPieceEntity(collectionId, pieceId)` with cascade.
- Files at `filesDir/pieces/<sha256>.mid`.
- Categories: **All** (title, ASCII-folded sort) · **Collections** (user folders and
  imported INDEX.csv collections) · **Composers** (group by `composerKey`, show
  `MIN(composer)`) · **Favorites** · **Recent** (`COALESCE(lastPlayedAt, addedAt) DESC
  LIMIT 100`). Search: case-insensitive contains on `searchText` (title + composer).
- Import sources: multi-select file picker; **folder** (`ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE`,
  recursive via `DocumentsContract` child queries — not `DocumentFile`); **zip**
  (`java.util.zip.ZipFile`, UTF-8, copied to cache first); "Open with" (`ACTION_VIEW`,
  `ACTION_SEND`, `ACTION_SEND_MULTIPLE`; MIME `audio/midi`, `audio/mid`, `audio/x-midi`,
  `application/x-midi`, plus `application/octet-stream` and `*/*` with `.mid`/`.midi`
  path patterns).
- Pipeline per file: bytes (8 MB cap) → SHA-256 → duplicate check (skip; fill a blank
  composer if the new import knows one) → parse (failure counted, logged) → metadata:
  `INDEX.csv` row if present (columns `collection,composer,title,size_kb,path`, RFC-4180
  quoting, path relative to the root) → else `^(.+?) - (.+)$` filename split → else
  title = file name; a stub title (`^[a-z0-9_\-\.]+$`) is replaced by Track 0's name when
  it contains a space and is not a generic name (control track, upper, lower, piano,
  track, untitled…) → `ComposerNames`: display name, surname, ASCII-folded lowercase
  `composerKey` ("" when unknown), override table for the 26 lowercase piano-midi.de
  folder names (`rachmaninow → Sergei Rachmaninoff`, `burgmueller → Friedrich Burgmüller`,
  `balakirew → Mily Balakirev`, `xmas → Traditional`, …); `ALL SONGS` names are
  double-encoded UTF-8 and are repaired
  (`String(name.toByteArray(ISO_8859_1), UTF_8)` when the name contains `Ã`/`â`) → write
  file → insert (transactions of 25) → CSV `collection` → get-or-create an imported
  `CollectionEntity` and link.
- `ImportProgress(done, total, imported, duplicates, failed, current, finished)` as a
  `StateFlow` in `AppGraph`.

## Settings — `settings/`

DataStore keys: `autoConnect: Boolean (true)`, `lastDeviceAddress: String?`,
`lastDeviceName: String?`, `noteDisplay: PAPER_ROLL | FALLING (PAPER_ROLL)`,
`defaultTempoPct: Int (100)`, `transpose: Int (0)`, `velocityPct: Int (100)`,
`foldOutOfRange: Boolean (true)`, `skipDrumChannel: Boolean (true)`.

## UI contract

- Use the provided `ui/theme` files **unchanged** (`PianoTheme`, `PianoTypography`,
  `PianoShapes`, `Tabular`, `Motion`, `rememberReducedMotion`, `LocalLive`,
  `LocalHairline`, `LocalDisabledGlyph`, `LocalTertiary`). Colour roles: contentPrimary
  = `colorScheme.onSurface`, contentSecondary = `colorScheme.onSurfaceVariant`,
  contentTertiary = `LocalTertiary.current`, hairline = `LocalHairline.current`,
  surfaceElevated = `colorScheme.surfaceVariant`. No colour literal outside `ui/theme`.
  Red (`LocalLive.current`) is read by `LiveDot` only.
- Screens and behaviour exactly as `DESIGN.md`. Bottom `NavigationBar`, three tabs:
  Library, Now playing, Piano. Single activity, Navigation-Compose, fade-through 240 ms
  between tabs (a cut under reduced motion).
- `NoteCanvas` (one `Canvas`, two styles from the `noteDisplay` setting): 84 lanes for
  MIDI 24–107 via a shared `KeyLayout`; notes travel **downward** in both styles.
  *Paper roll*: perforation-styled rounded bars, tracker bar (2 dp `onSurface`) one third
  up from the bottom with a 1 dp hairline 6 dp above it, history visible below.
  *Falling notes*: block-styled bars, hit line at the top of the keyboard strip, no
  history. Upcoming notes `onSurfaceVariant`; a note flips to `onSurface` over 120 ms as
  it crosses the line (cut under reduced motion) and stays so for its duration. Notes in
  start-sorted parallel arrays, binary search for the visible window, `withFrameNanos`
  writes one `Long` state read only inside `drawBehind`, `drawRoundRect` only, no
  per-note allocation, 60 fps with a 5,000-note piece. 320 ms ease-out from still to
  moving on play. Reduced motion: the canvas still moves (it is content), decorations cut.
- `KeyboardStrip`: 84 keys on a `Canvas`, active keys inverted, reads the two
  `AtomicLong` bitsets per frame.
- Timers use `Tabular`; eyebrow labels are `uppercase()` at the call site.
- Every icon-only control has a `contentDescription`. Layouts survive font scale 2.0.
- About row on the Piano tab shows `Provenance.text` ("Steven Piano · Made by Steven Jin
  · v1.1 · eab16a502f679465") and a one-line acknowledgement of the library sources.

## Authorship

- Every `.kt`, `.kts`, `.toml`, `.xml`, `.md`, `.py` starts with the adapted banner
  (copyright Steven Jin, attribution must be preserved, Ed25519 fingerprint
  `eab16a502f679465`, see `firmware/src/main.cpp:1-8`).
- `Provenance.kt`: `@Keep object` with the compiled-in string (R8 `-keep`), shown by the
  About row and duplicated as a manifest `<meta-data>`.
- `LICENSE` (MIT + attribution clause), `AUTHORS`, `PROVENANCE.md` adapted from
  `firmware/`; `provenance/sign.py` + `verify.py` variants over this tree (exclude
  `.git .gradle .kotlin .idea build .claude`; include `.kt .kts .toml .xml .md .py .pro
  .pem`, `LICENSE`, `AUTHORS`, `.gitignore`, `gradlew`, `gradle.properties`,
  `gradle-wrapper.properties`); public key copied from `firmware/provenance/`; the
  private key stays at `~/piano-authorship-PRIVATE-DO-NOT-SHARE.pem`, never in the repo
  (`.gitignore`: `*.pem`, `*PRIVATE*`, `!provenance/author_ed25519_public.pem`).

## Build & sideload

- `./gradlew assembleDebug assembleRelease testDebugUnitTest` must succeed from a clean
  checkout with JDK 17 and the Android SDK present (AGP fetches platform 36).
- `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk` for sideloading; release is signed with
  the debug keystore and minified (`-keep` for `Provenance`).
- `README.md`: what it is, build, sideload (Install unknown apps / `adb install`),
  importing the `midi/` folder or `ALL-SONGS.zip`, connecting (forget any stale
  "Steven Piano" bond first), battery-optimisation exemption, the device checklist.

## Acceptance

1. Import three `.mid` files via the picker; sensible titles; search finds them; a
   collection can be created and populated. Import the `midi/` folder: 1,727 pieces
   grouped by collection and composer.
2. Connect to "Steven Piano" from the Piano tab; the dot goes live; status Connected.
3. Play: the canvas moves, notes brighten crossing the line, the keyboard strip inverts,
   timers count with tabular figures, the piano plays in time. Tempo 50 % halves the
   rate live. Switching Note display while playing is seamless. Pause silences within
   ~50 ms (CC64=0 then CC123). Seek silences then resumes.
4. Lock the phone: playback continues from the notification. Swipe the app away: the
   piano is silent. Power-cycle the piano: the app reconnects within ~15 s.
5. Rotate, font scale 2.0, TalkBack: nothing overlaps, everything is labelled.
6. Unit tests green; no colour literal outside `ui/theme`; `LocalLive` only in
   `LiveDot.kt`; provenance verifies; the provenance string is in the release DEX.

# v1.1 — engineering additions

Read `DESIGN.md › v1.1` first. Everything in v1.0 stays; these are additions. The
engine, data and BLE layers keep their v1.0 contracts except where stated.

## Adaptive frame

- Add `androidx.compose.material3:material3-window-size-class` (or compute the class
  from `LocalConfiguration` if the artifact does not resolve). `WindowWidthSizeClass`
  drives the frame: Compact → bottom `NavigationBar`; Medium and Expanded →
  `NavigationRail` (labels shown, same four destinations, same glyphs). One or the
  other, never both.
- Four destinations: `library`, `nowplaying`, `keys`, `piano`. Keys takes the keyboard
  glyph; Piano gets a new sliders glyph.
- Now playing layout by class: Compact = one canvas whose style comes from
  `noteDisplay` (now `PAPER_ROLL | FALLING | STAFF`); Medium = `Column`(staff ⅓, notes
  ⅔); Expanded = `Row`(staff, notes) with the keyboard strip and transport spanning
  beneath. The wide-screen choice comes from a new setting `wideLayout: STAFF_AND_NOTES
  | NOTES_ONLY | STAFF_ONLY` (default `STAFF_AND_NOTES`).
- Reading surfaces cap content at 720 dp centred (`Modifier.widthIn(max = 720.dp)`).
- Keys visible range by class: Compact ≈ 2 octaves, Medium ≈ 4, Expanded all 84.

## Keys screen — `ui/screens/keys/`

- `KeysScreen`, `KeysViewModel`, `PlayableKeyboard` (a `Canvas` with
  `pointerInput` handling), `KeyMiniMap`, `SustainButton`.
- Geometry from the existing `KeyLayout` (84 lanes, C1–B7) scaled to a chosen visible
  range with horizontal offset; white keys full height, black keys 60 % height drawn
  after whites. Hit-testing prefers black keys within their rectangle.
- Keyboard height at most `min(320 dp, 45 % of the screen's height)` (M9 review: 790 dp
  keys on an upright tablet read as a barcode). The keyboard and the Sustain / VELOCITY /
  connection row sit at the bottom; the mini-map stays at the top; the space between is
  left empty.
- Multi-touch: track each pointer id → current key; on down send Note On; when a
  pointer crosses into another key send Note Off for the old key and Note On for the
  new (glissando); on up/cancel send Note Off. Velocity from the touch's y within the
  key's rectangle: `24 + (y / keyHeight) × (127 − 24)`, clamped.
- Sending goes through a new `LiveInput` in `player/` (or on `Player`): `noteOn(key,
  vel)`, `noteOff(key)`, `sustain(down)` that feed the same `NoteRouter` instance the
  player uses (so reference counting, the 100 ms guard and the silence sequence stay
  correct when a piece plays at the same time) and `PianoLink.send`. Live input
  bypasses transpose/fold (keys are already 24–107) but respects `velocityPct`.
- `silenceLive()` on `ON_STOP` of the screen, on app background, and on link drop:
  Note Off for every held live key and CC64 = 0 through the router.
- Mini-map: the 84-key strip in miniature with a draggable viewport; ‹ › buttons shift
  by one octave. State in the view model; persisted `keysViewportStart` (default C3).
- VELOCITY readout: Eyebrow + Tabular, shown for 1 s after each tap (no animation
  other than appear/disappear cuts).
- No haptics. `contentDescription` on the keyboard describes it as a playable piano
  keyboard; TalkBack users get the octave buttons and sustain as focusable controls.

## Staff view — `ui/components/StaffCanvas.kt`

- Same inputs as `NoteCanvas` (the `NoteList`, `positionMicrosAt(frameNanos)`, active
  keys); same frame loop and draw-phase-only state reads; same pixels-per-second so the
  two views stay in step.
- Layout: treble staff and bass staff, line spacing 6 dp, 40 dp between the staves,
  centred vertically in the available height; clefs at the left edge; playhead at ⅓
  width. Horizontal axis is time: x = playheadX + (noteStart − now) × pxPerSecond.
- Pitch → staff position: use sharps only. Diatonic step index from MIDI number
  (C=0, D=1 … B=6 per octave; black keys take the step of the natural below and a
  sharp). Notes ≥ 60 on the treble staff (E4 = bottom line), < 60 on the bass staff
  (G2 = bottom line); middle C on a ledger line below the treble staff. Ledger lines
  every second step outside the five lines, drawn per note for the head's width + 4 dp.
- Note head: filled ellipse 7 × 5 dp rotated −20°; sharp glyph 6 dp to the left of the
  head; duration bar: 1 dp hairline from the head's right edge for `duration ×
  pxPerSecond`. Heads a second apart in one chord offset by one head width. Cull to the
  visible time window with the same binary search as the roll.
- Glyphs: bundle Bravura (SIL OFL) as `res/font/bravura.otf` and draw clefs (U+E050
  G clef, U+E062 F clef), sharps (U+E262) and note heads (U+E0A4) with `drawText`
  via `TextMeasurer`; if the font cannot be obtained offline, hand-drawn vector paths
  for the two clefs and a plain ellipse head are acceptable. Add the OFL text to
  `AUTHORS`/`README` acknowledgements.
- Colours: staff lines `LocalTertiary` (M9 review: the hairline token all but vanished in
  dark mode), ledger lines the note's colour, clefs `onSurfaceVariant`, upcoming heads
  `onSurfaceVariant`, active heads `onSurface` with the 120 ms flip (cut under reduced
  motion), playhead `onSurface`.

## Settings (new keys)

`noteDisplay` gains `STAFF`; `wideLayout` (see above); `keysViewportStart: Int (48)`.

## Piano settings over Bluetooth

Specified in `firmware/docs/BLE_SETTINGS.md` (protocol) and the "Piano settings"
subsection below (app side), written once the firmware's command catalogue is
confirmed.

## Piano settings over Bluetooth — app side (M9)

Protocol: `firmware/docs/BLE_SETTINGS.md` (Nordic UART Service next to BLE-MIDI; console
commands in, replies out; `dump` / `get` for machine-readable state; allow-list). Design:
`DESIGN.md › v1.1 › Piano settings`.

### Link: a console channel on the same connection — `ble/`

- After service discovery, `GattPianoLink` looks for NUS `6E400001-…`. If present:
  enable notifications on TX `6E400003-…` (write CCCD `0x2902` = `0x0001`, one GATT op
  in the existing serialized queue) and remember RX `6E400002-…`.
- `PianoLink` gains `val console: ConsoleChannel?` (null when the piano has no NUS):
  `fun sendLine(text: String)` (appends `\n`, ≤ 79 characters, `WRITE_TYPE_NO_RESPONSE`
  to RX, ≤ MTU−3 bytes per write) and `val lines: SharedFlow<String>` (notifications
  reassembled on `\n`, `> ` echo lines dropped).
- Console writes share the single-operation GATT queue with MIDI. MIDI packets go
  first: a console write is dequeued only when the paced MIDI writer has nothing
  pending. Never let a console write delay a due MIDI packet by more than one op.
- `FakePianoLink` gets a scripted console (canned replies per command) for tests;
  `LoggingPianoLink` answers `dump` with a fixed plausible dump so the settings screen
  can be exercised on the emulator.

### Repository — `piano/PianoSettingsRepository.kt`

- `state: StateFlow<PianoState>` where `PianoState` = `Unknown` (not connected or not
  yet read) · `Unsupported` (no NUS, or `dump` not answered with `!proto=1 … end`
  within 2 s) · `Ready(values: Map<String, String>, facts: Map<String, String>,
  lastError: String?)`.
- On `LinkState.Connected` with a console: send `dump`; parse `name=value` lines into
  `values`, `!name=value` into `facts`, until `end`.
- `set(name, value)`: debounce 150 ms per name → `sendLine("$name $value")` → then
  `sendLine("get $name")`; the reply updates `values[name]`. Reply lines containing
  `out of range`, `usage:`, `unknown`, or `refused` become `lastError` (cleared on the
  next successful `get`). Booleans as `0`/`1`, floats with two decimals.
- `preset(name)`: `sendLine(name)` then `dump` (presets change several values).
- `action(name)`: `off`, `save`, `ledtest <midi>`, `testmin <midi>`, `testmax <midi>`,
  `status` (its text lines are collected into `statusText` until 300 ms of silence).
- `save()` is sent automatically when the Piano screen leaves the foreground after any
  successful `set` since the last save.
- On disconnect: `Unknown`. Values are never cached across connections (the piano is
  the source of truth).

### The table — `piano/PianoSettings.kt`

A static list of `PianoSetting(name, label, section, kind, unit)` where `kind` is
`Switch`, `Stepper(min, max, step)`, `Slider(min, max, step, decimals)` or
`Choice(options)`. Names are the firmware command names. Sections and members, in order:

- **LIGHTING**: `leds` Switch "Strip" · `ledmode` Choice Off/Static/Rainbow/Reactive ·
  `ledbright` Slider 0–255 shown as % · `reactcolor` Choice Rainbow/Solid/Velocity/
  Fire/Ocean/Forest/Lava/Party · `ledcount` Stepper 1–300 "LEDs" · `ledoffset` Stepper
  −300–300 · `ledscale` Stepper 10–400 % · `ledtail` Stepper 0–255 · `ledreverse` Switch
  · `ledglow` Stepper 0–10 · `velbright` Switch "Brightness follows velocity" · `decay`
  Stepper 1–40 · `rainspeed` Stepper 1–40 · **Test LED**: a Stepper for a key (24–107,
  default 60, shown as note name) and a *Light it* action (`ledtest`) · `dimsecs`
  Stepper 0–3600 s step 30 · `dimfloor` Slider 0–255.
- **FEEL**: presets chip row Soft · Cinematic · Expressive · Snappy · `fullpower` Switch
  "Full power (no dynamics)" · `volume` Slider 0–100 % · `velcurve` Slider 0.4–3.0 step
  0.05 · `velmult` Slider 0.1–5.0 step 0.1 · `min` Slider 0–4095 "White-key floor" ·
  `minblack` Slider 0–4095 "Black-key floor (0 = same as white)" · `max` Slider 0–4095

### Screen — `ui/screens/piano/PianoSettingsSections.kt`

- Rendered on the Piano tab between the connection card and the app preferences, per
  DESIGN. Every control reads its live value from `values`, shows the unit in its
  eyebrow, and calls `set` on change; sliders call `set` on value change (the
  repository debounces). Disabled with `LocalDisabledGlyph` handles while `Unknown`,
  with the line "Connect to the piano to adjust its settings."; the single line "This
  piano's firmware doesn't offer settings over Bluetooth yet." while `Unsupported`.
- `lastError` shows as an `OutlinedBanner` under the control's section.
- Every control has a `contentDescription` including its label and value; steppers'
  ± buttons are 48 dp.

### Tests

Parser (dump/get/`!` facts/end/timeout → Unsupported), debounce and write-then-get
ordering, error detection, preset → dump, `save` on leave, MIDI-before-console queue
priority in the link (with the fake), and the settings table's ranges matching
`BLE_SETTINGS.md` (a test asserts every name in the table is in the spec's list).

# v1.2 — M10: schema v2, playlists, the queue, the byline, rotation

Read `DESIGN.md › v1.2` first. Everything above stays except where this section says
otherwise. M11 (artwork) and M12 (score pages) add their own sections.

## Collections are playlists

One concept, called Playlists everywhere the person can see it (a grep for "collection" in
`ui/` is empty). The data layer keeps v1's table and column names so v1.1 libraries carry
over: `PlaylistEntity` is table `collections`, `PlaylistPieceEntity` is `collection_pieces`
(its playlist column is still `collectionId`), and `PieceEntity.collection` remains the
INDEX.csv `collection` column's value. `PlaylistDao` replaces `CollectionDao`.

## Room schema v2 — `data/db/`

- `collection_pieces` gains `position INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` and an index on
  `(collectionId, position)`. A playlist plays in `position` order, title for ties.
- New table `artwork` (`ArtworkEntity(key PK, imagePath?, description?, sourceUrl?,
  sourceTitle?, fetchedAt, status: OK | NOT_FOUND | FAILED)`, keys `composer:<composerKey>`,
  `piece:<id>`, `playlist:<id>`) and `ArtworkDao` (`observe`, `get`, `upsert`, `delete`),
  created now so v1.2 has one migration; the UI reads it from M11.
- `MIGRATION_1_2` (`Migrations.kt`) runs `SchemaV2.DDL`: the position column added with the
  exact definition in the exported `2.json` (the way Room's own auto-migrations add a column),
  then 2.json's `createSql` for the new index and the artwork table. It then numbers every
  playlist 0, 1, 2… ordered by `addedAt`, then title (then id), in Kotlin (API 26's SQLite has
  no window functions). No destructive fallback. `SchemaV2Test` holds the statements equal to
  `app/schemas/…/2.json` (and v2's link table equal to v1's plus that column); `1.json` is kept.
- Note for owners of 1.1 libraries: 1.1 listed a collection by title; 1.2 plays a migrated
  playlist in the order its pieces were added. Imported INDEX sets were added in import order.

## Library — `data/LibraryRepository.kt`

`playlists()` (summaries with `pieceCount` and total `durationMs`), `inPlaylist(id)`,
`playlistIdsOf(pieceId)`, `createPlaylist`, `renamePlaylist`, `deletePlaylist`,
`addToPlaylist(id, pieceId)` (one transaction: `nextPosition`, then insert at the end),
`removeFromPlaylist`, `reorderPlaylist(id, orderedIds)` (a drag; the ids may be a search's
subset, see `PlaylistOrder.reordered`), `movePiece(id, pieceId, delta)` (Move up / down), and
`summaries(ids)` (`PieceSummary(id, title, composerShort, durationMs, composerKey)` by id,
asked 500 ids at a time). Reorders write only the positions that change. The importer's
INDEX.csv links go to the end of their playlist.

## The queue — `player/Queue.kt` (replaces `Playlist.kt`)

- `QueueEntry(uid, pieceId)`: every entry has its own uid (numbering carries across queues),
  so a piece can be queued twice. `Queue(entries, index, original?, repeat, nextUid)` is
  immutable: `next / previous / previousRestarts / afterEnd / playNext / addToQueue /
  remove(uid) / move(uid, toUpNextIndex) / clearUpNext / skipTo / withShuffle(on, random) /
  withRepeat`, factories `startingAt(pieceId, ids, previous, random)` and `all(ids, shuffle,
  previous, random)`.
- Shuffle: the current piece stays first and plays on; the rest follow in random order;
  `original` keeps the order they had. Off: that order comes back. Play next goes after the
  current piece in both orders; Add to queue while shuffled stays out of `original`, so
  restoring puts it right after the current piece; moves in Up next change only the shown
  order; remove and clear take entries out of both. The current entry is never removed.
- Repeat (`RepeatMode.OFF | ALL | ONE`, the button cycles in that order): `afterEnd()` is the
  next entry, the top again (all), the same entry (one), or null. Next wraps with repeat all.
- `PlayerState.queue: QueueSnapshot(ids, uids, index, shuffle, repeat)` with `currentUid`,
  `upNextIds`, `upNextUids`, `hasNext`, `advancesAtEnd` and `window()` (at most 50 entries
  for the media session, starting five before the current one). `queueIndex` and `queueSize`
  remain as computed properties.

## Player — `player/Player.kt`

- New: `playAll(ids, shuffle)` (a playlist's Play or Shuffle; sets the shuffle mode),
  `playNext(ids)` and `addToQueue(ids)` (with nothing queued they start playing and return
  true), `removeFromQueue(uid)`, `moveInQueue(uid, toIndex)`, `clearUpNext()`,
  `skipToQueueEntry(uid)`, `setShuffle(on)`, `setRepeat(mode)`, and a `Random` constructor
  parameter for tests. `play(id, queue)` keeps the current modes.
- The end of a piece: 1.5 s later the player asks the queue again (Up next and the modes may
  have changed); the same entry again restarts the loaded piece with `engine.seek(0)` then
  `engine.play()`, without reading the file again (it still counts as a play).
- Settings gain `shuffle: Boolean (false)` and `repeat: RepeatMode (OFF)`; `AppGraph.start()`
  seeds the player with them and writes every change back.
- `PlaybackStarter.playAll / playNext / addToQueue` start the playback service when playback
  starts. `MediaSessionHolder` publishes the queue window (`setQueue`, uids as queue ids, names
  from `library.summaries`), the shuffle and repeat modes, the active queue item, and handles
  `onSkipToQueueItem`, `onSetShuffleMode`, `onSetRepeatMode`. `PlaybackService` keeps the
  foreground through the pause between pieces whenever `queue.advancesAtEnd`.

## UI

- `ScreenHeader(title, modifier, byline = Provenance.byline, actions)`: the byline "Player
  piano · by Steven Jin" in the eyebrow style under every tab title, no animation. The About
  row's `Provenance.text` drops the app's name: "Made by Steven Jin · v1.2 · eab16a502f679465".
- `TransportBar(playing, hasNext, shuffle, repeat, onShuffle, onRepeat, onPrevious,
  onPlayPause, onNext)`: 48 dp Shuffle and Repeat at the ends (tertiary off; primary with a
  4 dp dot on; descriptions "Shuffle on/off", "Repeat off/all/one"; Shuffle has the switch
  role); gaps shrink to fit 360 dp.
- Now playing: the queue glyph opens `UpNextSheet` (`UpNextViewModel`): a modal bottom sheet
  with the current piece, then up next with "Remove from queue" and a "Reorder" handle, Clear,
  tap to play, "Nothing up next." when empty. Its order is the queue's only.
- Library: `Category.Playlists`, `Group.Playlist`, `Listing.Playlists`; grids of tiles for
  Playlists and Composers (`AppFrame.tileColumns` 2 / 3 / 4, chunked rows inside the one
  `LazyColumn`), art is `MonogramTile` (`ui/components/Artwork.kt`) until M11. Tiles
  long-press: Rename · Delete (playlists; Change photo comes with M11), Play all · Shuffle
  (composers). `PlaylistHeader(summary, cover, onBack, onPlay, onShuffle, onRename, onDelete)`.
  Row menus through `PieceActions` (`PieceMenu`, three groups, destructive last); inside a
  playlist, and only while no search narrows it, rows carry a drag handle and Move up / Move
  down.
- `ui/components/DragReorder.kt`: `rememberDragReorderState(listState, canMoveTo, onMove,
  onDrop)`, `Modifier.dragHandle(state, key)` (consumes the drag, so a sheet stays put),
  `Modifier.reorderable(state, key, itemScope)` (lift with `surfaceVariant`, hairline and
  shadow; `animateItem()` for the others, a cut under reduced motion), `DragHandle` (48 dp,
  "Reorder", Move up / Move down accessibility actions), pure `targetIndex`, `moved`,
  `reorderedBy`. Keys are stable (`p<id>`, queue uids), comparisons are layoutInfo offsets only,
  the list keeps its scroll when the first visible row moves, and it auto-scrolls near the edges.
- New glyphs: `ic_shuffle`, `ic_repeat`, `ic_repeat_one`, `ic_queue`, `ic_drag_handle`, `ic_more`.

## Rotation

`MainActivity` handles `orientation|screenSize|screenLayout|smallestScreenSize|keyboardHidden`
itself, so rotating never recreates it: nothing is silenced, the latched Sustain stays down (so
struck strings keep ringing), and the window size class is recomputed from the new
configuration. `onStop` silences live keys only when not `isChangingConfigurations`.
`KeysViewModel` keeps the first white key as chosen and clamps it when read (21 stays 21 at 15
visible keys, shows 20 at 29, 0 at 49). Nothing may rely on recreation to refresh.

Android itself cancels every touch in progress when the display rotates (each window gets
`ACTION_CANCEL`; measured on the emulator with a device-level touch in M10), and a cancel lets go
of the key like a lift. So while any key is held (`KeyTouches.anyHeld`) the Keys screen asks for
`SCREEN_ORIENTATION_LOCKED` and gives the orientation back when the last key is let go or the
screen goes; a rotation asked for meanwhile happens then. Held keys and the pedal therefore
never see a rotation, and a key is never kept down without a finger the app can see.

## Version

1.2, `versionCode 3`. Provenance is re-signed at the end of v1.2 (M12), not per run.

## Tests added in M10

`QueueTest` (v1.1's three `PlaylistTest` cases kept), `PlayerTest` (repeat one restarts
without reloading, repeat all wraps, play-next order, enqueue with nothing queued),
`SchemaV2Test`, `PlaylistOrderTest`, `SettingsRepositoryTest` (shuffle and repeat),
`DragReorderTest`, `KeyboardGeometryTest` (rotation), `FormatTest` (playlist totals,
monograms), `AdaptiveFrameTest` (tile columns).

# v1.2 — M11: artwork and notes, tiles with art, the piece sheet

Read `DESIGN.md › v1.2 › Artwork and notes` first. Everything above stays except where this
section says otherwise; M12 (score pages) adds its own section. Schema unchanged (v2).

## Network policy

- `INTERNET` and `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`. Two hosts, no others: `en.wikipedia.org` (REST
  `api/rest_v1/page/summary/{title}`; `w/api.php?action=query&list=search&srsearch=…&srlimit=3&
  srnamespace=0&format=json&formatversion=2`) and `upload.wikimedia.org` (portraits). HTTPS only:
  `WikipediaUrls.allowed` refuses any other host, and redirects are followed by hand (at most 5)
  through the same check. The summary API hands images out on `thumb.wikimedia.org` with `utm_*`
  queries; they are rewritten to `upload.wikimedia.org` (the same files) without the query.
- What is sent: page titles and search terms built from the library's composer names and piece
  titles; nothing about the person. Every request, image downloads included, carries
  `User-Agent: StevenPiano/1.2 (https://github.com/stevenjin20090101-rgb/steven-piano-android)`
  and `Accept: application/json`.
- `net/WikipediaClient.kt`: `WikiApi { summary(title): WikiSummary?; search(query): List<String>;
  download(url, maxBytes): ByteArray? }` over `HttpURLConnection`: connect 10 s, read 15 s; 404/410
  → null; 429/503 → `WikiBusyException(code, retryAfterMs)`; other non-2xx → `IOException`; bodies
  capped before parsing (JSON 256 KB, past it an `IOException`; files at the caller's cap, 6 MB for
  images, past it null). Titles: spaces → `_`, then UTF-8 percent-encoding. `WikiJson` (org.json,
  kept thin: a stub on the JVM). Each request is logged at debug level (tag `Wikipedia`) with its
  wall-clock time.
- Image rule (`WikipediaUrls.image`): the original when ≤ 1024 px wide and jpg/png/gif/webp;
  otherwise the thumbnail rewritten to **960 px**. Wikimedia renders thumbnails only at its
  standard widths (… 330, 500, 960, 1280 …); `1024px-` answers HTTP 400 "Use thumbnail sizes
  listed on https://w.wiki/GHai" (measured September 2026), so 960 is the widest step within the
  1024 px limit. A narrower scan (TIFF) takes the widest step within its own width; drawings (SVG)
  always 960.
- `net/NetworkMonitor.kt`: `online: StateFlow<Boolean>` (default-network callback) for the UI,
  `isOnline()` (INTERNET capability on the active network) for the worker.

## Art keys, fetching and policy — `data/art/`

- `ArtKey.Composer(composerKey, display)` → `composer:<composerKey>`; `ArtKey.Piece(id, title,
  composer)` → `piece:<id>`; `playlist:<id>` rows are the person's photos, never fetched.
  `ArtworkDao` gains `observeAll()`; `PieceDao` gains `idsByComposer(key, limit)` and
  `firstComposerKey(playlistId)` (queries only).
- `ArtworkFetcher` (pure over `WikiApi`): a composer's page name is `ComposerNames.canonical(key)`
  (now public) or the display name; blank, "Traditional", "Anonymous", "Unknown", "Various" →
  NOT_FOUND with no request; `type == "disambiguation"` → one retry as "{name} (composer)"; a
  composer outside the canonical list is taken only when the page's description or extract is
  about music (so a namesake's photograph never shows); the portrait is downloaded. A piece:
  search "title composer" (the composer's full name); the first hit that is not the composer's
  page nor a disambiguation and whose extract names the surname (accents folded) gives the
  extract, title and URL; text only. `IOException` → FAILED; `WikiBusyException` → wait as asked
  once (5 s when unsaid, never past 60 s) and retry; asked again → `Fetched.Busy`.
- `ArtworkPolicy.shouldFetch(existing, now, force)`: nothing recorded → yes; OK → never; NOT_FOUND
  → only when forced; FAILED → 24 h later, or when forced, or when the clock went backwards.

## Repository, worker, files, bitmaps, roll cards

- `ArtworkRepository` (`AppGraph.artwork`): `artwork(key): Flow<ArtworkEntity?>` (one shared map
  of every row: one query per change to the table, however many rows and tiles watch), `peek(key)`,
  `request(key, priority, force)`, `requestComposers(force): Int`, `composersDue()`,
  `cancelBackground()`, `progress: StateFlow<ArtworkProgress(done, total, current, idle)>`
  (background work only; a sheet's own request is not counted), `online`, `bitmap(row | key,
  size)`, `cached(row, size)`, `setPlaylistPhoto(id, uri)` (copied at once through the picker's
  transient grant, turned upright from EXIF, JPEG ≤ 1024 px on the longer side), `rollCard(pieceId)`,
  `cachedRollCard(pieceId)`, `mosaicPieces(composerKey)` (first four by title, cached until the
  pieces change), `firstComposerKey(playlistId)`, `forget(key)` (row and file, when a playlist or
  piece is deleted).
- `ArtworkWorker` (pure; confined to the app scope's main thread): one queue, strictly sequential;
  `request` appends, or puts first when `priority`; duplicates merge (and move up); `requestAll`
  queues only what is due; offline → skipped, nothing recorded (a failure seen while offline is
  not recorded either); `Busy` → pause as asked (≥ 1 s), or past a minute drop the rest of the
  background run for the next start. `RequestPacer` + `PacedWikiApi`: ≥ 250 ms between request
  starts (measured on the emulator: 250–254 ms).
- `ArtFiles`: `filesDir/art/<readable key>-<crc32>.<jpg|png|gif|webp|img>`, written atomically;
  paths stored relative to `filesDir`. Downloads are kept as they came, after a decodability check.
- `BitmapCache`: bounds pass, then the smallest power-of-two `inSampleSize` that brings the shorter
  side to ≤ `ArtSize.Row` 128 / `Tile` 512 / `Full` 1024 px; `LruCache` sized by
  `allocationByteCount` (⅛ of the heap, ≤ 48 MB); `OutOfMemoryError` → no picture.
- `RollCard.render(notes)`: a 256 × 256 alpha map of the 20 s after the first note, 84 lanes (C1–B7,
  folded by octave), time running up from the bottom row, alpha 120–255 by velocity, each lane's
  last column left as paper, notes at least two rows tall. Drawn as an `ALPHA_8` bitmap tinted with
  `onSurfaceVariant`, so no colour lives in it. A composer with no portrait shows a 2 × 2 mosaic of
  their first four pieces' cards (two pieces as a checkerboard; a single piece's card whole).

## Service — `service/ArtworkService.kt`

dataSync foreground service, channel "artwork", notification "Fetching artwork and notes" with
"Claude Debussy · 12 of 61" and a progress bar. `start(context, force)` queues
`requestComposers(force)`, follows `progress` and stops itself when the worker is idle (unless
another start is still queueing). Started by `ImportService` after an import with `imported > 0`,
while that service still holds the foreground (Android 12+ refuses most background starts), when
`fetchArtworkAutomatically`; by `MainActivity.onStart` → `AppGraph.fetchArtworkIfDue()` when
automatic, online and a composer is due (a 1.1 library, an import made offline, a day-old failure);
and by the `+` sheet's "Fetch artwork and notes for every composer" with `force = true`. If Android
refuses the start, the same work runs in the app's process without the notification.
`onTimeout(startId)` and `onTimeout(startId, fgsType)` drop the background queue and stop; nothing
is recorded for the rest, so the next start fetches it.

## Settings

`artworkMonochrome: Boolean (false)`, `fetchArtworkAutomatically: Boolean (true)`. Piano tab rows
"Artwork in black and white" and "Fetch artwork automatically" with the line "Uses Wikipedia.
Nothing about you is sent." beneath; the About area adds that sentence and "Text from Wikipedia,
CC BY-SA 4.0 · portraits from Wikimedia Commons".

## UI

- `ui/components/Artwork.kt`: `ArtFrame` (square, `surfaceVariant`, a 1 dp `LocalHairline`
  outline drawn over the picture, `shapes.medium`, no semantics), `MonogramTile`, `Monochrome`
  (saturation 0) through `LocalArtworkMonochrome` (provided by the nav host), `rememberArtworkRow`,
  `rememberArtwork(key, size)`, `ArtworkImage(key, size, modifier, fallback)`, `RollCardImage`,
  `MosaicTile`, `ComposerArt` (portrait → mosaic → monogram), `PlaylistCover` (photo → first
  piece's composer portrait → monogram). Portraits crop a little above centre.
- Library: tiles show art (`AppFrame.tileColumns`); playlist tiles long-press Rename · Change photo
  | Delete; `PieceRow` leads with a 40 dp `ComposerArt` (divider inset to the text, 72 dp);
  `ComposerHeader(portrait, name, meta, blurb = Sentences.firstTwo(description), sourceUrl, onBack)`
  with a "From Wikipedia" link (the blurb is Wikipedia's text); `PlaylistHeader(…, onChangePhoto,
  …)`; `PickVisualMedia(ImageOnly)`; `ArtworkBar` ("Fetching artwork 12 of 61") shares the import
  bar's hairline progress row; the `+` sheet gains the fetch action under a hairline.
- `ui/screens/piece/PieceDetailSheet(pieceId, onDismiss)`: `ModalBottomSheet` with its drag handle;
  art = the composer's portrait (`Full`), else the piece's roll card; title `titleLarge`; composer
  Eyebrow; then `PieceNotesChoice.of(piece, composer, online, waiting)`: the piece's extract, else
  the composer's (once the piece's own fetch is done, or offline), with "From Wikipedia" and the
  attribution Eyebrow; "No notes found for this piece."; "Notes need an internet connection." when
  offline with nothing kept; a hairline while the piece's fetch runs (at most 12 s). Opening it
  asks for the piece (and a never-looked-up composer) first in line. Opened from the Now playing
  title (`onClickLabel = "About this piece"`) and from "About this piece" in the row menu
  (`PieceActions.about`, first group, after Add to queue). Material 1.4's sheet keeps the height
  it opened at when its content grows, so the sheet calls `expand()` again when its notes change.

## Tests added in M11

`WikipediaUrlsTest`, `ArtworkFetcherTest` (against `FakeWikipedia`), `ArtworkPolicyTest`,
`ArtworkWorkerTest` (virtual time: strictly sequential, 250 ms spacing, offline skip and no record,
priority to the front, FAILED backoff, busy waits and long waits, cancellation, progress),
`RollCardTest` (identical bytes for the same notes; lane 0 marks the expected pixels), `ArtFilesTest`
(names, signatures, atomic writes, sample sizes), `SentencesTest` ("J. S. Bach"), `ArtworkCopyTest`,
`ComposerNamesTest` (+ `canonical`), `SettingsRepositoryTest` (+ the two keys).
